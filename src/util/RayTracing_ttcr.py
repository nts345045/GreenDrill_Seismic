:module: RayTracing_ttcr.py
:auth: Nathan T. Stevens
:purpose: Contains convenience wrappers for using the ttcrpy (ttcrpy.readthedocs.io)
		project for 2D and 3D ray tracing 

Primarily built upon the worked examples in the ttcrpy repository:
https://github.com/groupeLIAMG/ttcr/blob/master/examples/example1.ipynb
https://github.com/groupeLIAMG/ttcr/blob/master/examples/example2.ipynb
https://github.com/groupeLIAMG/ttcr/blob/master/examples/example3.ipynb

:: TODO ::
This is a place-holder for possible implementation to ttcrpy for ray-tracing
to replace the current implementation of pyrocko.Cake for 1-D ray-tracing.
